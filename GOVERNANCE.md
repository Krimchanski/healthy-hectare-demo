Healthy Hectare Platform

Governance, Oversight & Operating Framework

1. Governance Purpose

Healthy Hectare is operated as a public transition platform supporting the reduction of highly hazardous pesticide use through verified participation, evidence-based practice, and institutional accountability.

This platform is governed as transition infrastructure.

It is not a campaign site, advocacy blog, or marketing platform.
It is designed to operate as a public-interest system suitable for review by regulators, funders, researchers, and institutional partners.

Governance ensures:

integrity of claims
legitimacy of participation
accountability of operations
transparency of decision-making
trust in outcomes

2. Governance Principles

The platform operates under five core principles:

2.1 Public Interest First

All platform decisions are guided by:

human health protection
environmental protection
food system resilience

public accountability

Commercial, political, or reputational interests may not override public interest.

2.2 Evidence-Based Practice

All participation, methods, and outcomes must be grounded in:

peer-reviewed science
regulatory frameworks
field validation
reproducible methodologies

Anecdotal claims, marketing assertions, and unverified practices are not accepted as evidence.

2.3 Verification Before Recognition

Participation does not imply endorsement.

Recognition is granted only after:

eligibility screening
documentation review
methodological assessment
verification against programme criteria

This applies to farms, funders, and research partners.

2.4 Institutional Accountability

The platform is designed for:

regulator review
donor scrutiny
research ethics oversight
public transparency

All governance structures are inspectable.

2.5 Progressive Maturity

The platform evolves in phases:

Phase I: Pilot & verification design
Phase II: Public participation & data ingestion
Phase III: Institutional integration & regulatory reporting

Each phase introduces additional controls, oversight, and safeguards.
